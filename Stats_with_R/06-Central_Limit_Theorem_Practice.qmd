# Questions

Suppose you take a sample of size $n=5$ from a right skewed distribution with a population mean, $\mu=125$ and a standard deviation, $\sigma=12$

__Question__: What is the mean of the distribution of sample means ($\mu_{\bar{x}}$)?  
__Answer__:

__Question__: What is the standard deviation of sample means ($\sigma_{\bar{x}}$)?  
__Answer__:

__Question__:  What is the *shape* of the distribution of sample means and why?  
__Answer__:


Now suppose you increase the sample size to $n=100$.  What is:

__Mean of sample means__:  
__Standard deviation of sample means__:  
__Shape of the distribution of sample means__:  


Describe the difference between the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.  
__Answer__:
